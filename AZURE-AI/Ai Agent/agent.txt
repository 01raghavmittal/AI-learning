🛠️ Running an Agent You Already Created

You can directly run it using either non‑streaming or streaming methods:

⚡ Non‑Streaming Run 
    How it works:  
    You send a request, the agent processes it fully, and you get the entire response at once.

    Code example:
    response = await agent.run("Write me a poem about flowers")
    print(response.text)   # full text result
    
    Pros:
    Simple to use.
    You get the complete answer in one object (AgentRunResponse).
    Easier if you just want the final result.

    Cons:
    You wait until the agent finishes before seeing anything.
    Not ideal for long or detailed outputs.

🌊 Streaming Run
    How it works:  
    The agent sends partial updates as it generates the response. You can print or process chunks in real time.

    Code example:
    async for update in agent.run_stream("Write me a poem about flowers"):
        if update.text:
            print(update.text, end="", flush=True)

    Pros:
    You see the response as it’s being generated (like live typing).
    Useful for long answers or interactive experiences.
    Can handle tool calls or status updates mid‑response.

    Cons:
    Slightly more complex to handle since you process multiple updates.
    You need async iteration.
